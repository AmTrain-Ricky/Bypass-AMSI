# Pwn-Town
Here are all of my notes for the Pwn Town lab!

Starting out
---
The first thing you want to do is get everything prepared. Some things I would to (to make your life easier) is:
* On your local computer, save the RDP configuration to make connecting easier
* Find the `pentest-tools` folder on the lab machine and pin that to quick access

Bypassing AMSI
---
The first major hurdle is bypassing AMSI, or Antimalware Scan Interface. After trying to run some of the powershell tools, you'll quickly notice they can't run because they "contain malware".
